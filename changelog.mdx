  ## New Features

  ### Queue scheduling

  - Added the Queue feature to help teams keep a steady posting rhythm without choosing individual times for every post.

  - You can create a set of regular posting days and times in **Settings** under **Social Media** and **Publishing Schedule**.

  - When sharing content you can now choose **Add to queue**, and Framework automatically places the post into the next available slot.

  - Queued posts keep their order even when you adjust your publishing schedule.

  - You can update or remove queue times at any point and choose whether existing queued posts should follow the new schedule.

  ### Google Business Profile

  - Added the ability to connect and publish directly to Google Business Profile.

  - You can link your Google Business Profile from **Settings** in the **Social Media** tab and manage it like your other connected platforms.

  - Once connected you can schedule and post updates to Google Business Profile from both the template editor and the planner.

  - This integration gives you another channel to keep your local audience informed with timely updates.

  ## Improvements

  - Updated the social media connection flow to give clearer guidance on required permissions and account types.

  - Enhanced the planner view so Google Business Profile posts and queued posts display more consistently across all layouts.
