## Finding a template

You can begin by exploring the template categories in the sidebar. These categories help you discover designs that suit different types of content.

There is also a **Search** field in the sidebar. Type a keyword to see matching templates. This is useful if you know roughly what you want to create.

All templates you see in the library can be edited. Some templates allow you to upload your own images. These show a small camera icon in the template gallery. Certain templates also support badges, which are elements like award logos that you can insert during editing.

## Opening the editor

Click on any template to open the editor. This is where you can change text, images and custom fields such as your website and phone number.

### Editing text

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Text resizes automatically to fit the design. It helps to keep the amount of text similar to the template preview to maintain readability.

Click into any text field and type your content. If you add too much text the automatic resizing can make it quite small, so it is worth checking that the finished design stays easy to read.

### Selecting images

Templates that support image uploads allow you to replace the placeholder with your own photo.

When uploading an image it is helpful to match the orientation of the original.\
For example, if the template uses a landscape photo you will get the best result by uploading a landscape photo of your own.

Uploaded images are stored in your account and can be used again in future designs.

### Using badges

Some templates include badge areas. These can be used for elements such as award graphics or recognition icons. If a template supports badges you will see the option when you are editing.

## Using AI in the editor

Framework includes an AI helper inside the editor for times when you want to generate text more quickly.

Select **AI** at the top of the editor and enter a short prompt. Framework will fill in the text fields based on your brand guidelines and tone of voice.\
The AI also aims to produce a suitable amount of text for the design so that the layout remains balanced.

This is helpful when you want variations, ideas or quick copy that still feels on brand.

## Creating your design

When you have finished customising your template select **Create**.\
Framework will process your layout, resize elements and prepare the final design. This usually takes around ten seconds.

You can preview the result and then decide whether to download it, share it to social media or return to the editor to make changes.

## Finding your created designs

All designs you create are saved automatically.

Visit **Created Graphics** in the sidebar under **Assets** to see your history.\
Framework stores up to 90 days of past designs. You can open any of them to edit, re-download or remove as needed.

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  You can upload many images at once from the Assets area. These become available inside the editor whenever you need them.
