description: >-
  The Analytics section gives you a clear view of how your social media content
  is performing. It is a useful place to see what your audience responds to,
  which posts have done well and how your overall activity is developing over
  time.


  Once your social media accounts are connected Framework starts collecting
  analytics automatically.

## What you can see

Analytics shows a summary of key performance indicators across your channels.\
These include:

• Likes\
• Comments\
• Shares\
• Reach and impressions (where available)\
• Number of posts within the selected date range

This helps you spot patterns and understand which types of content have worked best.

## How data updates

Framework updates analytics each hour.\
If you do not see data straight away it may be that the latest update has not arrived yet so it is worth checking back after a short while.

There is a **Refresh** button in the page. This pulls in the most recent data that Framework currently holds.\
The hourly updates happen in the background even if you do not press refresh.

## Filters and options

Along the top of the Analytics page you will see several filters that help you explore your data.

### Filter by platform

You can view all platforms together or narrow your results down to a single channel such as Instagram or Facebook.

### Choose your date range

Pick from preset ranges or select a custom date range if you want to look at a specific period.\
This is useful when reviewing campaigns, holidays or seasonal content.

### Sort your results

You can sort your posts in different ways.\
For example:

• Most liked\
• Most comments\
• Most shares\
• Newest or oldest first

Sorting helps you quickly identify your best performing posts.

## How analytics can help

Analytics can support you in planning future content.\
It can highlight the types of designs that get the most engagement, show when your audience is most active and give you a sense of what works well across your locations.

Many users review their analytics weekly to see small trends or monthly to get a wider overview.
