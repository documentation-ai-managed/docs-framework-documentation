description: >-
  The Campaign Planner gives you a simple way to see upcoming marketing activity
  in one place. It brings together campaigns shared by your national office and
  any local campaigns you create yourself. This helps you plan your own social
  media and local marketing content with a clear view of what is happening in
  the wider brand.

## What the Campaign Planner shows

When your national office shares campaigns they appear automatically in your planner.\
You will see them arranged on a calendar so you can quickly understand what is coming up, which dates matter and how those campaigns might affect your local activity.

You can click on any campaign to see more details.

  The Campaign Planner is especially helpful when you want to plan your own content around national activity or events.

## Creating your own local campaigns

You can add your own campaigns to the planner. This is useful for local events or promotional activity.

For example, if you are hosting a community event or running a local promotion you can add it to the calendar so the rest of your team can plan content around it.

To add a campaign:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the planner" icon="calendar" title-type="p">
    Go to the **Planner** page in the sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Switch to campaigns view" icon="layers" title-type="p">
    Toggle to the **Campaigns** tab at the top.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a new campaign" icon="plus" title-type="p">
    Select **Add Campaign** in the top right.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the details" icon="edit" title-type="p">
    Give your campaign a name, add a description and choose a start and end date.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your campaign will appear on the calendar in a different colour so you can easily distinguish local campaigns from national ones.

## Editing or deleting local campaigns

If you want to remove a local campaign simply select it on the calendar and choose **Delete**.\
This only removes your own campaign. Campaigns shared by national office cannot be deleted.
