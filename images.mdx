  Photos and images are one of the easiest ways to personalise your designs.
  Most templates allow you to add your own images and anything you upload is
  saved in Framework so you can use it again in future designs.


  This page explains the different ways to add images, how to manage them and
  where brand images appear.

## Adding images in the template editor

Many templates include image areas that you can replace with your own photos.\
When you open a template that supports image uploads you will see an option to add or replace the image.

  Tip: Upload a photo that suits the space in the design. For example, if the placeholder image is landscape, a landscape photo will usually give the best result once it is fitted to the template.

Any image you upload here is stored automatically so you can reuse it in other designs without having to upload it again.

## Uploading images from the sidebar

You can also add images directly to your account before you start designing.

Go to **Assets** in the sidebar, then select **Images**.

\
From there choose the **Our Images** tab. This is where you can upload one or many images at once.

\
Everything you upload here becomes available inside the template editor for you and your team.

### Managing your images

You can hover over any image to download it or delete it.\
If you want to delete several images at the same time select **Select**, choose the ones you want to remove and confirm the deletion.

## Brand images

When you sign up to Framework you will often see a library of **Brand Images** already in place. These are usually provided by your national office or brand team and include photography that matches your brand guidelines.

Brand images are grouped into categories which you can browse using the filters in the Brand Images tab.\
You can use these images in your designs just like your own photos.

If you need any of the brand images outside Framework you can hover over one and select **Download**.

  Anything you upload during template editing is saved automatically in the Our Images area, so your whole team can use the same images without uploading them again.
