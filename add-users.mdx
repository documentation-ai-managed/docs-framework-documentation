  can add new team members at any time and remove users who no longer need
  access.

## Adding a user

Go to **Settings** from the sidebar and open the **Users** tab. Here you will see a list of your current users.

To add someone new select **Add User**.

Enter their details and choose the franchise locations you want them to have access to.

Once you send the invite the user will receive an email asking them to sign in and join Framework.

After they join they will have access to your templates, images, created graphics and any other shared resources. This makes it easy for new team members to get started straight away.

## Removing a user

If someone no longer requires access you can remove them from the same Users tab.\
Select the user you want to remove and follow the prompts to confirm.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Removing a user immediately revokes their access to Framework.\
  It does not remove any content they have previously created.
</Callout>
