title: Quick Start
description: >-
  Welcome to Framework. This guide walks you through the first things to do
  after signing in so you can create and share designs with confidence. You do
  not need screenshots for this part. Everything is described in a
  straightforward way that you can follow at your own pace.
---
## Start in Settings

Once you sign in at go.getframework.app the best place to begin is **Settings**. This prepares your account and makes sure Framework can publish content for you.

<Expandable title="Connect your social accounts" default-open="true">
  Connecting your social accounts lets you publish and schedule directly from Framework.\
  You can connect Facebook, Instagram, Google Business Profile and LinkedIn and more.



  You will also see **Publishing Schedule**.



  This is where you set a small queue of posting times. Many teams choose two or three slots during the week.

  \
  When you publish something later you can add it to the queue and Framework will place it in the next available slot.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Profile details" default-open="false">
  Update your phone number, website and other basic details.\
  Framework places these fields into templates automatically so it helps to keep them accurate.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Users" default-open="false">
  Add your team members here.\
  When you add a user they receive an email invite and can join your workspace straight away.
</Expandable>

## Exploring the template library

Your day to day work will happen in the template library on the left side of the app. Templates are grouped by category so you can browse until you find a design that suits what you want to create.

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-3b35621b-84ac-4f46-a54c-13ef46ab0f69/doc-b7c9c3a9-f17d-466e-b8ba-31e8cf79ba38/1765039598379-iqjej7eah5k-Template-gallery.Template gallery?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="3280" height="1812" alt="" />

When you click a template you enter the customisation screen.
