  Before sharing anything you will need to connect the social media accounts you
  want to publish to.

Framework supports Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, Threads, TikTok and YouTube.

To connect an account go to **Settings**, then open the **Social Media** tab.\
Here you can see the status of existing connections and add new ones using the **Connect** button.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Framework uses GetLate to create a secure connection to your accounts. Your login details stay private. GetLate sends Framework a token once you approve access. You remain in control of the permissions you grant and you can remove access at any time.
</Callout>

### Who can connect accounts

Only someone with the correct access level on the social media platform can create the connection.\
For example, you will need manager or admin access for business pages before linking them.

### Requirements for each platform

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Instagram" default-open="false">
    Instagram business accounts must be linked to a Facebook page.\
    If you are not sure you can check this through Facebook’s own [guidance](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/898752960195806).\
    If they are not linked you can follow the same [guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/898752960195806) to connect them.

  <Expandable title="Facebook" default-open="false">
    You will need to be an admin or an editor of the Facebook page to connect it to Framework.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Other platforms" default-open="false">
    Access levels vary slightly by platform. Someone with the correct permissions will need to approve the connection.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

### Reauthorising or removing access

If you change your password on a connected platform, the connection to Framework may need to be refreshed. Go back to **Settings** then **Social Media**, open the connection and select **Refresh Connection**.

You can also disconnect a platform here. If you disconnect a platform you will no longer be able to publish content to that account from Framework.
